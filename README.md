# Description

"Thataburger" is a fun little burger logger app. It allows the user to input whatever burger description they want, then add the burger to a list of burgers to "devour" and once devoured, the burger is moved and saved to a list of devoured burgers. It is created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. All devoured burgers are saved to the database.

## Development

This project is my first full-stack application and is by far the most complex programming work I've ever done. I learned how to link a MySQL database to Node, write HTML with Handlebars, write an ORM, and connect everything together. 

### Deployment

This application is deployed on Heroku at https://infinite-spire-90667.herokuapp.com/

#### Github

This project has a Github repository at https://github.com/Linus41/Burger
